        <h1> New York City Park Trails in designated 'Forever Wild' areas.</h1>
    <div>
       <p> NYC Parks' "Forever Wild" initiative protects over 500 acres of unique, ecologically valuable sites across all five boroughs.</p>
        <p> <!-- Link to dataset -->
            This analysis spans the years 2013-2025, and is based on datasets provided by NYC Open Data:

    <div> <!-- Brief overview -->
        <p>This project investigates whether trail development classifications in NYC’s
“Forever Wild” park areas correspond to measurable structural changes over time,
including trail width and surface material.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Research Question -->
    <div id = "stateOne">
    <h2>Research Question:</h2>
    <p>Do trail development classifications correspond to structural changes in width and surface material over a ten-year period?

    </div>

    <!-- Hidden Hypothesis -->
    <div id = "stateTwo" style="display:none;">
        <h2>Hypothesis:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> Higher development classes will have wider trails. </li> 
        <li> Higher development classes will show more artificial surfaces. </li> 
        <li> Surface of trails may shift over time toward increased development.</li> 
        </ul>
    </div>
<div>
    <!-- Research Question -->
    <div id = "methodology">
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Cleaned the dataset by removing missing values and ensuring width was stored as a numeric variable.</li>
    <li>Extracted the year from the date column to analyze trends over time.</li>
    <li>Calculated average and median trail width by year to look for structural changes.</li>
    <li>Normalized surface counts into proportions within each year to see if any trends changed.</li>
    <li>Used line plots, boxplots, and tables to compare development class with trail width and surface type.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Hidden Hypothesis -->
    <div id = "limitations" style="display:none;">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Width measurements are rounded to the nearest foot, limiting subtle changes over time.</li>
        <li>Uneven sampling across years</li>
        <li>Data on difficulty and development class are subjective</li>

<h2>Trail Qualities Over Time</h2>

<div class="graph-row">
 <div class="graph-card">
        <img src="dirt_paved_overtime.png" alt="Surface Composition Over Time">
        <p>I hypothesized that there could be a change in surface materials for trails over time that would signify development. 
            However, surface composition remains relatively stable over time. I have dropped other surface variables to look at high indicators or development versus non-development, 
            pavement and dirt, with dirt trails consistently representing the largest proportion of observed trails. There are four points when dirt trails drop under paved, 
            however the gap in dirt over paved remains higher for longer.  While paved trails show a noticeable increase between 2024 and 2025, this shift may reflect sampling variation 
            rather than a long-term structural trend. </p>
    </div>
</div>


<div class="graph-row">
    <div class="graph-card">
        <img src="width_overtime.png" alt="Median Width Over Time">
        <p>I hypothesized that trail width would increase over time as an indicator of progressive development. However, the average width begins at approximately 
            7 feet and shows a slight decline between 2014 and 2018. Given the small magnitude of change and variation in yearly sample sizes, this pattern likely reflects 
            sampling variability rather than meaningful structural evolution. Additionally, width values were recorded as whole feet, limiting sensitivity to minor changes. 
            Even accounting for this measurement constraint, the overall stability of the trend suggests that substantial widening did not occur during the observed period.</p>
    </div>
 </div>

<!-- Development Over Time -->
<h2>Development Over Time</h2>
<div class="graph-row">
    <div class="graph-card">
        <img src="development_overtime.png" alt="Median Width Over Time">
        <p>The highest proportion of trails recorded are in Class III: Developed. This fact is reflected in this line plot as it is the highest line for the majority of years, 2013-2025. 
            The minimally developed trails remain at the lowest points of the graph. This imbalance may partially reflect data collection bias, as undeveloped trails may be less formally documented or surveyed.
            There is no clear indication that a certain class of development had a significant upward trend, suggesting that development is not obvious from this observed period. 
        </p>
    </div>
 </div>

 <div class="graph-row">
    <div class="graph-card">
        <img src="class_comp_year.png" alt="Median Width Over Time">
        <p>From another perspective we see that Class III: Developed is the highest proportion of trails. Again there is no significant trend shift of development within the ten year period. In this chart it is momre obvious that there is a complete drop in Class I: Minimal/Undeveloped trails. </p>

<h2>Conclusion and Ongoing Work</h2>
    <p> This analysis is an ongoing examination on whether qualitative trail characteristics, including width and surface material, reflect increasing development trends over time in NYC 'Forever Wild' areas.
         Development classifications and surface types remain relatively stable in terms of highest and lowest averages over time. Notably in 2025, there were few Class I: Undeveloped trails recorded. This point could be interesting to explore, and I will look closer at 2025 for any insights. 
            </p> <p> 
         Notably, fully developed trails consistently represent the largest proportion of recorded observations, though this may reflect documentation bias.
         Future analysis will further evaluate whether development class correlates directly with artificial surface materials and wider trail structures. Expanding the dataset to include additional NYC parks data could also provide broader 
         insight into structural development patterns across the city’s park system.
