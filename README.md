NYC Parks' "Forever Wild" initiative protects over 500 acres of unique, ecologically valuable sites across all five boroughs.

This analysis spans the years 2013-2025, and is based on datasets provided by NYC Open Data: Parks Trails Dataset

This project investigates whether trail development classifications in NYC’s “Forever Wild” park areas correspond to measurable structural changes over time, including trail width and surface material.
